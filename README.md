## 📄 Project Summary
This project focuses on the design, implementation, simulation, and synthesis of a 5-stage pipelined processor conforming to the base RV32I Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). The design is verified using a comprehensive set of test programs, including hazard handling (forwarding, stall, and flush), and synthesized using Quartus Prime.

## 🧪 Verification and Simulation
- 156 test instructions executed to verify all 39 RV32I instruction types.
- Simulated using Verilator, logs captured in `sim_rslt.sv`.
- Testbench: `processor_tb.sv` (cycle-accurate analysis).
- Functional coverage includes:
  - Data hazards (RAW) with stall and forwarding
  - Control hazards with flushing
  - Load-use hazard with stall insertion

## 🧮 Synthesis
- Synthesized using Intel Quartus Prime.
- Netlist views and utilization reports provided for top-level and submodules.

## 🔮 Conclusion and Future Work
This processor implementation successfully achieves functional correctness and synthesizability for the RV32I ISA. Future enhancements may include:
- Support for RV32IC (compressed instructions)
- Integration of branch prediction and dual-issue pipeline
- Extension toward full SoC integration with peripheral I/O
